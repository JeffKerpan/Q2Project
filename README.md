# JumpNote

[JumpNote](http://jumpnote.herokuapp.com/) JumpNote is an application that lets
you take notes alongside of a video. We stamp your notes to the time in the
video so you can easily reference back to that moment when you made the note.
Type along to lectures or live streams, then share those notes and videos with a
friend.

First, create an account! Then, log in to see a your profile page that contains
any videos and notes that you have saved and shared.

Your profile page allows you to search for videos, see your saved videos and any
videos that have been publicly shared.
